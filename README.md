## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

- Navigate to the project directory:
cd wc-takehome

- Build and run the Docker container:
docker pull mrajic/wc-takehome
docker run -d -p 8888:80 wc-takehome

Alternatively, a simple Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files can be used to generate a new image that includes the necessary content (which is a much cleaner solution than the bind mount above and edit files inside of the running container):

``` docker
# Use an official WordPress image as the base image
FROM wordpress:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Copy your WordPress files into the container
COPY . .

# Set proper ownership for Apache
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

# Install MySQL client
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

# Install WP-CLI
RUN curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar && \
    chmod +x wp-cli.phar && \
    mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

ENV WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress \
    WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress \
    WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=password

# Expose the necessary port
EXPOSE 8888

# Enable live updates during development
RUN rm -rf /var/www/html/*

# Start the Apache server
CMD ["apache2-foreground"]
```

docker-compose.yml file
``` docker-compose
version: '3'

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    restart: always
    environment:

  wordpress:
    build:

      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:

      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: password
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
